**Directory: 0x05-processes_and_signals**

**Description:**
The 0x05-processes_and_signals directory contains a collection of scripts and programs focusing on processes and signals in Unix/Linux systems. These scripts cover various aspects, including process management, signal handling, and understanding process IDs (PIDs).

**File List:**

1. **0-what-is-my-pid:** This script likely prints the PID (Process ID) of the current process, providing insight into how processes are identified in the system.

2. **1-list_your_processes:** This script may list information about running processes on the system, such as their PIDs, parent processes, resource usage, and status.

3. **100-process_and_pid_file:** This script may involve working with PID files, which are commonly used to store the PID of a running process for monitoring or management purposes.

4. **101-manage_my_process:** This script could focus on managing processes, possibly including functionalities like starting, stopping, or restarting a specific process identified by its PID.

5. **102-zombie.c:** This file likely contains a C program demonstrating the concept of zombie processes, which are terminated but still have an entry in the process table until their parent processes retrieve their exit status.

6. **2-show_your_bash_pid:** This script may specifically target the Bash shell process, displaying its PID, which can be useful for various system administration tasks and debugging.

7. **3-show_your_bash_pid_made_easy:** Similar to the previous script, this one might provide an easier or more streamlined way to obtain the PID of the Bash shell process.

8. **4-to_infinity_and_beyond:** This script's title suggests it could involve creating a process or task that runs indefinitely, potentially demonstrating how to manage such processes.

9. **5-dont_stop_me_now:** This script may be designed to create a process that resists termination attempts, possibly demonstrating the concept of process management and signal handling.

10. **6-stop_me_if_you_can:** This script could be an interactive exercise where the user attempts to terminate a running process, testing their understanding of process control and signal handling.

11. **67-stop_me_if_you_can:** This script seems to be a continuation or variation of the previous one, potentially offering additional challenges or scenarios for terminating processes.

12. **7-highlander:** This script's title suggests it could be inspired by the Highlander principle ("There can be only one"), perhaps involving process management or ensuring only one instance of a process runs at a time.

13. **8-beheaded_process:** This script may involve terminating or killing processes forcefully, possibly demonstrating the use of signals like SIGKILL or other techniques for terminating processes.

14. **manage_my_process:** This script appears to offer a more comprehensive approach to managing processes, likely including functionalities for starting, stopping, and monitoring processes based on user input.
