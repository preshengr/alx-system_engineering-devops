## File Descriptions and Usage

### 1. 2-app_server-nginx_config

**Description**: This file contains the Nginx configuration for a basic application server setup.

**Usage**:
1. Copy the content of `2-app_server-nginx_config` to your Nginx configuration directory (usually `/etc/nginx/sites-available/`).
2. Create a symbolic link to this file in the `sites-enabled` directory:
   ```bash
   sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/2-app_server-nginx_config /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/
   ```
3. Test the Nginx configuration:
   ```bash
   sudo nginx -t
   ```
4. Reload Nginx to apply the changes:
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl reload nginx
   ```

### 2. 3-app_server-nginx_config

**Description**: This configuration builds on the previous file, adding enhancements such as security headers or other optimizations.

**Usage**:
1. Follow the same steps as for `2-app_server-nginx_config`.
2. Ensure that the enhancements meet your application's requirements before applying them.

### 3. 4-app_server-nginx_config

**Description**: This configuration file includes advanced settings, such as load balancing or caching configurations.

**Usage**:
1. Replace the previous Nginx configuration file with `4-app_server-nginx_config` in the `/etc/nginx/sites-available/` directory.
2. Create or update the symbolic link in the `sites-enabled` directory.
3. Test and reload the Nginx configuration as described in the previous steps.

### 4. 4-reload_gunicorn_no_downtime

**Description**: A script to reload Gunicorn without any downtime.

**Usage**:
1. Make the script executable:
   ```bash
   chmod +x 4-reload_gunicorn_no_downtime
   ```
2. Run the script whenever you need to reload Gunicorn:
   ```bash
   ./4-reload_gunicorn_no_downtime
   ```

### 5. 5-app_server-nginx_config

**Description**: This configuration file might include further optimizations or specific tweaks for production environments.

**Usage**:
1. Apply the configuration as done with the previous Nginx configuration files.
2. Test thoroughly to ensure it works as expected in your production environment.

### 6. app-server

**Description**: This file could be a script or configuration related to the application server itself (such as starting the server or setting environment variables).

**Usage**:
1. Review the content of the file to understand its purpose.
2. Follow any instructions provided within the file or execute it as needed.

### 7. gunicorn.service

**Description**: A systemd service file for managing the Gunicorn application server.

**Usage**:
1. Copy the `gunicorn.service` file to the systemd directory:
   ```bash
   sudo cp gunicorn.service /etc/systemd/system/
   ```
2. Reload the systemd daemon to recognize the new service:
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl daemon-reload
   ```
3. Enable the Gunicorn service to start on boot:
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl enable gunicorn
   ```
4. Start the Gunicorn service:
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl start gunicorn
   ```
5. Check the status of the Gunicorn service:
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl status gunicorn
   ```
