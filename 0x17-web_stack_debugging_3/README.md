Inevitably, every software system is bound to encounter failure, which could arise from numerous sources such as coding errors, unexpected influx of traffic, security breaches, equipment malfunctions, acts of nature, or simple human slip-ups. These incidents of failure are not only expected but can serve as valuable learning experiences. A proficient Software Engineer should take these opportunities to learn from the mistakes and implement safeguards to prevent their recurrence. While initial failures are part of the learning curve, repeated failures due to the same cause are unacceptable.

The practice of conducting a postmortem is commonplace in the technology sector. Following any system downtime, the responsible team(s) will draft a report with two primary objectives:

Firstly, to disseminate information regarding the outage's origin to all company personnel. Given that outages can significantly affect a business, it is crucial for management and executives to grasp the incident's nature and its potential repercussions on their operations.
Secondly, to confirm that the fundamental issue(s) leading to the outage have been identified, and to ensure that steps are taken to rectify the problem and prevent future occurrences.
