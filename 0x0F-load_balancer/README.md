This directory contains scripts and configuration files related to load balancing, created as part of the curriculum at ALX Holberton School.

**Files:**

1. **0-custom_http_response_header**: This script sets up a custom HTTP response header on a web server.

2. **1-install_load_balancer**: This script installs and configures a load balancer.

3. **2-puppet_custom_http_response_header.pp**: This Puppet manifest sets up a custom HTTP response header on a web server using Puppet configuration management.

**Guided Step-by-Step Usage:**

1. **0-custom_http_response_header**:
   - Run the script to set up a custom HTTP response header on your web server.

2. **1-install_load_balancer**:
   - Execute the script to install and configure a load balancer.

3. **2-puppet_custom_http_response_header.pp**:

**Reasons for Project Design:**
1. **Scalability**: Load balancing is crucial for distributing incoming network traffic across multiple servers to ensure optimal performance and prevent overload on any single server.
2. **High Availability**: Load balancers enhance the availability of web applications by directing traffic away from servers that are experiencing issues or downtime.
3. **Performance Optimization**: By evenly distributing traffic, load balancers help optimize server resources and improve response times for end users.
4. **Fault Tolerance**: Load balancing setups often include redundancy and failover mechanisms to ensure continued operation in the event of server failures or network issues. This increases system reliability.
5. **Ease of Management**: Automation scripts and configuration management tools like Puppet simplify the setup and maintenance of load balancing configurations, reducing manual effort and potential errors.
